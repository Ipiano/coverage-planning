Coverage-Planning
=================
An implementation of "Complete coverage path planning in an agricultural environment"<sup>1</sup>

Background
----------
The problem of Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) is a difficult one to solve. The goal of a CCPP algorithm is to find a path which can be used to traverse an area such that the entire area is covered and to find a path such that it is the 'least expensive' by some critera. While there is no known perfect solution to the problem, there are a number of algorithms which provide sufficiently optimized solutions for most uses.

The algorithm defined by Theresa Driscoll in her 2011 thesis at Iowa State University is one such algorithm. Driscoll's algorithm extends upon the work of Jin<sup>2</sup> which provides algorithms for the problem as applied specifically to farming. This project is an implemetation of Drisoll's work.
